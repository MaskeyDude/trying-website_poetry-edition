                Hold me just for today...
                <br> Hold me just for an hour or moments even if they're few,
                <br> Hold me till I cry and I'm okay,
                <br> Hold me because I wanna cry like rain, not like the morning dew,
                <br> It was so hard to choose you today,
                <br> And here comes my heart that decides to keep on choosing you,
                <br> It knows I'm made of stone and it's your wamrth that makes me feel at home
